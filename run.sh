# Interactive, idempotent setup + start for the DuploCloud Extension Dev Kit.
#
#   ./run.sh                       first run prompts for email and requests a trial license. You are emailed
#                                  a verification link: click it and the license is issued and picked up
#                                  automatically (this run waits up to 2 minutes for it). Then it prompts
#                                  for password/LLM provider and starts everything; later runs are
#                                  silent (no prompts). They also adopt any changed framework defaults
#                                  (image tags/platform) from .env.example, keeping your overrides.
#   ./run.sh --reset               wipe the DB + all configured values (incl. provider credentials) and
#                                  start fresh. This is the ONLY thing that clears credentials from .env —
#                                  normal restarts never touch them; use --reset to switch providers cleanly.
#                                  Your license is left alone: it is not stack state, and DuploCloud issues
#                                  exactly ONE per email address, so there is nothing to gain by discarding it.
#   ./run.sh --reset-license       forget the license too (the JWT and the ids it can be re-fetched from).
#                                  Prints the JWT first: DuploCloud will NOT issue a second one for this
#                                  address. Restore it with --license <jwt>, or let a later run recover it —
#                                  it asks the server to email you a link that releases the same license.
#                                  Combine with --reset, or use alone to re-license (with --license, or a
#                                  new --email).
#   ./run.sh --license <jwt>       use a license JWT you already have (no licensing call is made).
#   ./run.sh --email <addr>        set/correct the admin email. While a license request is still unverified
#                                  this also replaces it: the saved request id can only verify the address it
#                                  was made for, so a new address drops it and requests again. That is how you
#                                  get out of a mistyped email whose verification link you never received.
#   ./run.sh --no-metrics          opt out of usage metrics (default is opted in); --metrics opts back in.
#   ./run.sh --email a@b.com --password 'pw' --model anthropic --anthropic-key sk-... --no-metrics   non-interactive.
#   ./run.sh --model bedrock --aws-access-key-id AKIA... --aws-secret-access-key ... [--aws-session-token ...] [--aws-region us-west-2]
#   ./run.sh --model bedrock-instance-role [--aws-region us-east-1]   Bedrock via this EC2 instance's IAM role (no keys).
#
# On an EC2 host the provider prompt first probes whether the instance role can actually invoke Bedrock
# (scripts/detect-bedrock.sh) and, if so, offers that as a third, keyless option.
#
# On completion it has: obtained a trial license for your admin email (Licensing__Token in .env),
# pulled+started the stack, minted a permanent admin API token into .env
# (DUPLO_ADMIN_TOKEN), and created a 'extension-dev' workspace (EXTENSION_DEV_WORKSPACE_ID). All values persist in .env.

# Checked here, after flag parsing (so --help still works on a bare machine) and before the first line
# that needs either one — setenv() below is already python3. Both are hard requirements, so report every
# problem in one pass rather than making the user re-run to discover the next one.
#
#   python3  every .env write and every JSON response in this script and in scripts/ is parsed with it.
#            No version floor: only the stdlib (json, sys, os, datetime, base64) is used, so anything
#            still called python3 is new enough.
#   docker   the whole stack, and every extension build, runs in containers. Compose must be v2, i.e.
#            the `docker compose` subcommand — the standalone `docker-compose` v1 binary is not used.
#
# The daemon-not-running case is a warning, not an error: `docker compose pull` further down reports it
# far better than we can, and failing here would block the flag-only paths that never touch the daemon.
