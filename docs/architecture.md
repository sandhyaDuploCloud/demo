# Architecture

How the pieces fit. Orientation, not a specification — for the authoring detail, see the reference guides
in [`.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/`](../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference).

## The stack

Nothing here builds from source. Every service pulls a published image pinned by a tag in `.env`.

| Service | Image | Port | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `duplo-ai-studio` | `quay.io/duplocloud/duplo-ai-helpdesk-devkit` | 60031 | The platform API, serving `/v1/aiservicedesk`. Owns extensions, workspaces, resources, and tickets, and enforces the license in `Licensing__Token`. |
| `duplo-ui` | `quay.io/duplocloud/duplo-ai-helpdesk-ui` | 4210 | The Angular portal. The image serves the SPA only; the mounted `nginx/default.conf` proxies API prefixes to the studio, so the browser sees one origin and there is no CORS. |
| `claude-code-agent` | `quay.io/duplocloud/duplo-agent` | 8010 | The LLM agent that executes provisioning tickets. Calls back to the studio at `http://duplo-ai-studio:60021`. |
| `mongo` | `mongo:6.0` | 27018 | All platform state, including the `loaded_extensions` records. |
| `xterm` | `quay.io/duplocloud/duplo-xterm` | 6061 | In-browser terminal. The browser reaches it on the published host port, so `AIStudio__XtermHost` must be host-reachable. |
| `init-perms` | `busybox:1.36` | — | One-shot. Chowns the shared named volumes to uid 1001 so the non-root studio and agent can write them. Named volumes are created root-owned, so this runs on every startup. |

Ports shown are the dev kit's `.env.example` defaults, offset from the platform's standard ports so this
stack can run alongside a full local platform. See [configuration.md](configuration.md#host-ports).

## Volumes

| Volume | Mounted by | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mongo_data` | mongo | The database, including `loaded_extensions`. |
| `platform_data` | studio, agent | The shared `/data` file store — skills and loaded-extension skill files. Shared so the agent can read the skills the studio seeded. |
| `extension_studio_data` | studio | Unpacked hot-loaded extension bundles. |
| `claude_sessions` | agent | Agent sessions, under its real home (`/home/appuser/.claude`). |

Because extensions live in a named volume **and** are recorded in Mongo, they survive a container
recreate: `ExtensionReplayHostedService` re-registers the active records on boot. That is why
`./stop.sh && ./run.sh` keeps your extensions, and `./stop.sh --wipe` does not.

## What an extension is

One extension is a single deployable unit that becomes a **first-class resource type** in the platform:

| Part | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | A C# resources controller, service, and entity, compiled against the host SDK. |
| Frontend | An Angular 22 Native-Federation remote — list, add, and view components — loaded into the portal at runtime by its `remoteEntry.json` URL. |
| Provisioning skill | The instructions the agent follows when a resource of this type is created. |
| `manifest.json` | Id, version, REST segments, routes, and menus. |

It is packaged as a single `extension.zip`.

## The build and hot-load loop

```

            │                                                │

                                                                  │
                                                                  ▼
                                                      live in the UI, no restart
```

1. **Build.** `build-extension.sh` validates naming, reads the host's SDK version, downloads the SDK
   bundle, runs `dotnet publish` and the frontend build, then excludes every assembly the host already
   provides and zips what is left.
2. **Deploy.** `deploy-extension.sh` POSTs the bundle to `load-bundle`.
3. **Live.** The new resource type appears with no host restart. Creating one in the UI fires a
   provisioning ticket.
4. **Provision.** The ticket is assigned from the workspace's agent list — which is why a workspace needs
   an agent attached before anything provisions, and why `run.sh` runs `register-agent.sh`.

Because the build compiles against the SDK of the *running* platform, upgrading the studio image can mean
a new SDK — rebuild and redeploy after an upgrade.

## Local versus remote

The same scripts drive either target. `scripts/_target.sh` resolves the base URL and token from
`DUPLO_TARGET`:

- **`local`** — this stack at `http://localhost:$STUDIO_PORT`, authenticated with `DUPLO_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
- **`remote`** — an existing DuploCloud platform at `DUPLO_HOST`, authenticated with `DUPLO_TOKEN`.

Real environment variables override the file, so CI can supply both as secrets with no `.env` at all.

## Access model

The UI's accessible-workspace list is permission-set based, with no superuser bypass. An admin token can
hit every API while the portal still shows no workspaces. `run.sh` therefore creates three things beyond
the `extension-dev` workspace: a permission set granting it, a permission-set group assigning your user,
and the workspace itself. Without them, login lands on `/app/auth/no-tenant-access`.
