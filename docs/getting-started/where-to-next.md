# 6. Where to next

**What you'll do:** pick your next destination — there are four, and this page says when you'd want
each one rather than just what it is.

**What you need first:** [4. Build your first extension](build-your-first-extension.md) — a running
platform with an extension loaded into it. If you skipped ahead from an earlier page, everything below
still applies.

## 6.1 The authoring manual — when you need to know how something actually works

The guide you have just finished gets one extension running. It does not teach the extension model.
That is the 16 numbered guides in
[`.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference),
and **they are the source of truth** — the `/duplo-extension` authoring command reads them directly,
so what they say is what gets built.

| Guide | Reach for it when |
| --- | --- |
| [`00-naming.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/00-naming.md) | Before anything else. REST segments, Mongo collection prefixes, and identifier rules that `build-extension.sh` validates and rejects |
| [`01-architecture.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/01-architecture.md) | You want the provisioning architecture end to end before writing code |
| [`02-authoring-guide.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/02-authoring-guide.md) | You are writing a straightforward extension and want the common path |
| [`03-base-classes.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/03-base-classes.md) | You need to know what the SDK base classes already do for you before overriding them |
| [`04-hooks.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/04-hooks.md) | You need to intervene in the lifecycle — which hook fires when, and what it may change |
| [`05-custom-actions.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/05-custom-actions.md) | Your resource needs to do something that is not create/read/update/delete |
| [`06-registration.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/06-registration.md) | You are wiring the manifest, or reconciling in-platform vs local registration and SDK versions |
| [`07-scope-credentials.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/07-scope-credentials.md) | Your provisioning needs the cloud or cluster credentials behind the scope it was given |
| [`08-parent-child-and-menus.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/08-parent-child-and-menus.md) | One resource owns many of another, or you want nested left-hand menu entries |
| [`09-result-templates.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/09-result-templates.md) | You want the result rendered without hand-writing HTML for it |
| [`10-sdk-api.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/10-sdk-api.md) | You are calling cloud or Kubernetes APIs from your C# — the `Duplo.Ai.Studio.Extensibility.Infra` surface |
| [`11-deprovisioning.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/11-deprovisioning.md) | You need deletion to be correct — it differs per provisioning mode |
| [`12-enrichment-and-live-state.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/12-enrichment-and-live-state.md) | The detail view should show real current infrastructure state, not just what was persisted at create |
| [`13-current-user.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/13-current-user.md) | You need the logged-in user in the frontend, the backend, or an agent skill |
| [`14-forms-and-wizards.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/14-forms-and-wizards.md) | The create form is more than a handful of fields, or needs multiple steps |
| [`15-error-handling.md`](../../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/15-error-handling.md) | An API error is failing silently instead of showing up in the UI |

## 6.2 The samples — when you want to see a pattern already working

[`samples/`](../../samples) holds nine extensions. Each demonstrates one pattern rather than a whole
product, so pick by the problem you have:

| Sample | What it demonstrates |
| --- | --- |
| [`helloworld`](../../samples/helloworld) | **Start here.** The canonical typed extension — C# `ResourcesController` + service + entity, an Angular Native-Federation remote (list/add/view), and a provisioning skill. Takes `firstName` + `lastName`, produces `fullName`. This is what the authoring skill copies and adapts |
| [`enrichment-pods`](../../samples/enrichment-pods) | Agent-based provisioning combined with C# enrichment: a skill deploys MinIO (Deployment + ClusterIP Service) into the Kubernetes scope's namespace, and `EnrichResultAsync` injects the live pods on every GET |
| [`parent-child`](../../samples/parent-child) | Two typed resources in one DLL — a `HelloParent` owning many `HelloChild`, with the child mounted at a nested route and listed from the parent's view |
| [`passthrough-configmap`](../../samples/passthrough-configmap) | Passthrough mode: a Kubernetes ConfigMap created, updated, and deleted synchronously on CRUD — no agent, no worker |
| [`worker-appstack`](../../samples/worker-appstack) | Worker mode against real cloud objects: a Deployment plus a Service, reconciled in dependency order by a background worker with retries |
| [`worker-compute`](../../samples/worker-compute) | Worker mode for work that is not a cloud object at all — two numbers in, sum and product out, no scope required |
| [`on-demand-plan`](../../samples/on-demand-plan) | No-provision mode: the resource persists immediately and no ticket fires; a provisioning run is triggered later, on demand |
| [`form-wizard`](../../samples/form-wizard) | A multi-step create wizard with per-step validation, and the self-contained stepper component to copy (the shared UI library ships none) |
| [`form-complex`](../../samples/form-complex) | A dense conditional form: dropdowns, sections that appear only when relevant, repeatable key/value rows, and a collapsible group |

Every sample builds with a plain `npm install` + `npm run build`. There is no `ng serve` dev shell: an
extension frontend is a remote loaded into the portal, not a standalone app, so the loop is
build → deploy → hot-load.

## 6.3 The rest of the docs — when you need the reference, not the tour

The full index is [docs/README.md](../README.md). The pages you are most likely to want next:

| Page | Reach for it when |
| --- | --- |
| [architecture.md](../architecture.md) | You want to know what you have actually been running — how the studio, agent, UI, xterm, and Mongo fit together, and how the hot-load loop works |
| [configuration.md](../configuration.md) | You need to change something in `.env` and want to know the default, the effect, and whether it is managed for you |
| [cli-reference.md](../cli-reference.md) | You want a flag you did not use in this guide — every entry point in `run.sh`, `stop.sh`, `logs.sh`, and `scripts/`, including which commands destroy what |
| [upgrading.md](../upgrading.md) | A newer dev-kit version is out and you want it without losing your extensions or your configuration |
| [faq.md](../faq.md) | You have a question before something breaks — licensing, data, platform support, what happens on upgrade |

## 6.4 Going to production, and contributing back

**This kit is licensed for local development only.** That is not a soft recommendation:

- [TERMS.md](../../TERMS.md) — the terms covering the proprietary `quay.io/duplocloud/*` container
  images and the vendored UI library. Local development only.
- [NOTICE](../../NOTICE) — the boundary drawn plainly: what the Apache-2.0
  [LICENSE](../../LICENSE) covers (the dev-kit source you have been editing) and what it does not
  (the images and the vendored library).
- **Running any of this in production is a licensing conversation, not a configuration change.**
  Email **sales@duplocloud.net** for a production license.

Contributing:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) — **your own extensions stay in your repo.** The dev kit is
  clone-and-own, `extensions/` is yours, and nothing in it belongs upstream. Improvements to the
  *framework* — the scripts, the samples, the authoring skill, these docs — are what we take as PRs.
- [SUPPORT.md](../../SUPPORT.md) — where to ask and what to expect. GitHub Issues, best effort, no
  SLA. Read it before opening one; it lists exactly what to include.

That is the end of the path. Back to [the index](README.md) if you want to re-walk a page, or
[troubleshooting.md](../troubleshooting.md) if something is not behaving.
