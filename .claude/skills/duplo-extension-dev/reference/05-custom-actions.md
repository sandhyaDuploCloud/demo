# Patterns — Custom Functionality Beyond CRUD

CRUD + `status`/`results` come free. Real resources usually need more: lifecycle actions (start/stop),
live cloud state on view, logs/shell, and action buttons in the UI. Here are the platform patterns, each
with a real in-repo reference.

## 1. Custom controller endpoints (lifecycle actions)

Add `[HttpPost]`/`[HttpGet]` actions to your resource controller, alongside the inherited CRUD. The
action resolves the resource, then calls a cloud SDK using the scope's credentials.

**Reference:** `AWSRdsInstancesController`
(`Duplo.AI.DataManagement.DevOps/Controllers/User/AWSRdsInstance/AWSRdsInstancesController.cs`) adds:
```
POST …/environment/awsrdsinstances/{id}/start
POST …/environment/awsrdsinstances/{id}/stop
POST …/environment/awsrdsinstances/{id}/reboot
GET  …/environment/awsrdsinstances/engines        (catalog/helper reads)
```
Pattern: the controller delegates to a service method that holds the AWS SDK client; cloud credentials
come from the resource's scope. In a **extension**, declare the same on your controller:
```csharp
[HttpPost("{id}/restart")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Restart(string workspaceId, string id, CancellationToken ct) {
    var entity = await ResourceServiceFacet.GetByIdAsync(id, ct) ?? /* 404 */;
    // … call your cloud/SaaS client using credentials resolved from entity.Spec.ScopeIds …
    return Ok(/* result */);
}
```

## 2. Live cloud detail on view — `EnrichResultAsync`

To show **current** cloud state (not the last persisted result), override `EnrichResultAsync(entity, ct)`
on your service — it runs inside `GetByIdAsync`, after the row is read, before it's returned. Fetch live
state with the scope credentials and stamp it onto `entity.Result` (in-memory only). This is how a
resource view shows fresh status without a write.

For Kubernetes objects there's a higher-level pattern: `K8sPassthroughServiceBase<TResource,TSpec,TResult,TK8sObject>`
(`Duplo.AI.DataManagement.DevOps/Services/K8sPassthroughServiceBase.cs`) applies the spec's manifest
directly to the cluster and serves live detail from a source-data cache (no per-row API call). Use it as a
model if your extension manages k8s objects.

## 3. Viewing logs / shell (Kubernetes)

The platform exposes pod logs as a **workspace + scope-scoped** endpoint:
```
GET /v1/aiservicedesk/user/data/workspaces/{workspaceId}/scopes/{scopeId}/k8s/pods/{podName}/logs
```
(`Duplo.Ai.DataManagement/.../Controllers/User/WorkspacesController.cs`). The UI renders it in an xterm
log viewer: `kub-pod-logs.component.ts` (`ai-studio/src/app/resources/kubernetes/kub-pods/kub-pod-logs/`)
calls `getPodLogs(podName)` (or an injected `podLogsLoader`) and polls while "follow" is on. Interactive
shell (`kubectl exec`) attaches through the **xterm service** (`AIStudio:XtermHost`), which runs the exec
and bridges the container's stdin/stdout to the browser.

For a extension that manages a workload: resolve the workload's `scopeId` (from the resource's scope), then
either link to the existing logs viewer or call the logs endpoint from your remote and render it.

## 4. Surfacing actions in the resource view (view-template menus)

The generic resource view (`<app-resource-template-view>`) is driven by a **view-template JSON** served
from `GET …/<restSegment>/view-template` (file:
`resources/resources-frontend-templates/<Type>/<subType>.view-template.json`). Fields can declare menus:

```jsonc
// resources/resources-frontend-templates/AppService/kubernetes-app-service.view-template.json
{ "key": "ov_deployment", "type": "single", "value": "result.deploymentName",
  "cardMenus": [ { "id": "restart-deployment", "label": "Restart" } ] },
{ "key": "ov_pods", "type": "table", "source": "result.pods",
  "rowMenus": [ { "id": "logs", "label": "Logs" }, { "id": "kubectl-exec", "label": "Exec (kubectl)" } ] }
```
`field-renderer.component.ts` renders the kebab and emits a `MenuActionEvent`
`{ menuId, level: 'row'|'card', fieldKey, row? }`; the view component dispatches on `(level, fieldKey,
menuId)`. Reference: `view-app-service.component.ts` (`onMenuAction` → opens logs/exec, restarts a
deployment). Ship your extension's `<subType>.view-template.json` with `cardMenus`/`rowMenus` and handle the
events in your view to wire custom actions with **no host changes**.

## 5. Action buttons in your extension's Angular remote

If your extension ships its own remote (list/add/view), add buttons in the view component that call your
custom backend endpoints via the injected `REMOTE_DuploHttpClient`, or navigate with the shared host
`Router`. (The hello-world remote's "Track Provisioning Status" button is a worked example: it resolves
the ticket name via the tickets origin-context endpoint and navigates to the service-desk chat.) Reach
the host through the `REMOTE_*` string DI tokens; the remote's UI uses the platform library
`@duplocloud-internal/ng-common-lib` (see [02-authoring-guide](02-authoring-guide.md#frontend-optional-but-recommended)).

## 6. End-to-end: an extra controller API your remote consumes (the "view logs" pattern)

This is the general recipe for any feature the generic framework doesn't give you — fetching logs/console
output, triggering an external action, reading live metrics. You add an endpoint to **your** controller and call
it from **your** remote. App Services "view logs" is the canonical UX; here it is generalized for an extension.

**Backend — add the action to your `ResourcesController<>` subclass.** It's auto-discovered as an
ApplicationPart, so no host change. Enforce workspace ownership, return the standard `ApiResponse<T>` envelope,
and map failures to status codes (model on `AWSRdsInstancesController.InvokeLifecycleAsync`).

```csharp
public record ConsoleResponse(string Text, bool Building, int? NextStart);

[HttpGet("{id}/console")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Console(string workspaceId, string id,
        [FromQuery] int start = 0, CancellationToken ct = default) {
    var entity = await ResourceServiceFacet.GetByIdAsync(id, ct);
    if (entity is null || entity.OwnerWorkspaceId != GetWorkspaceIdFromRoute()) return NotFound();
    try {
        // call the external system using creds resolved from entity.Spec.ScopeIds (see 07-scope-credentials),
        // or read entity.Result for stored output.
        var (text, building, next) = await _svc.FetchConsoleAsync(entity, start, ct);
        return Ok(ApiResponse<ConsoleResponse>.SuccessResult(new(text, building, next)));
    } catch (HttpRequestException ex) {
        return StatusCode(502, ApiResponse<object>.ErrorResult($"upstream error: {ex.Message}"));
    }
}
```

Route: `GET …/workspaces/{workspaceId}/environment/<restSegment>/{id}/console?start=0` — the resource-scoped
prefix and auth are inherited from the base controller.

**Frontend — call it from your remote and render it.** Reach the host HTTP client via the `REMOTE_DuploHttpClient`
string token. Unwrap `r?.data`. Two shapes:

```typescript
// datasource (in your remote)
console(wsId: string, id: string, start = 0): Observable<ConsoleResponse> {
  return this.api.get<ApiSingleResponse<ConsoleResponse>>(
    `/v1/aiservicedesk/user/data/workspaces/${wsId}/environment/builds/${id}/console?start=${start}`
  ).pipe(map(r => r?.data));
}

// (a) a log/console viewer that polls while the job is running — model on kub-pod-logs.component.ts
this.poll$ = interval(3000).pipe(
  takeUntil(this.destroy$),
  switchMap(() => this.ds.console(this.wsId, this.id, this.cursor)),
).subscribe(r => { this.append(r.Text); this.cursor = r.NextStart ?? this.cursor; if (!r.Building) this.stop(); });

// (b) a one-shot action button (e.g. "Trigger build") that POSTs then refreshes
trigger(): void { this.ds.post(`…/${this.id}/trigger`, {}).subscribe(() => this.reload()); }
```

Render in a modal (`NgbModal`, like the AppService logs viewer) or an inline tab in your view — your choice.
Handle errors with the injected error reporter; never print secrets.

**Why this matters for extensions:** the generic resource view only knows spec/result. Anything richer —
streaming logs, live external state, custom operations — is your controller endpoint + your remote consuming it.
The platform doesn't need to know the feature exists.

## 7. Action-driven lifecycle (plan/apply/destroy) with streamed logs + run history

When provisioning is a **repeatable, long-running operation** the user re-triggers (terraform plan/apply/
destroy, a redeploy, a re-sync), model it as **one long-lived ticket per resource** that the agent reconciles
on demand — not a fresh ticket per run.

**Trigger — bump a spec field, don't create a ticket.** Add `POST {id}/actions`; it records the request on the
spec and returns `202`. Use a **monotonic** timestamp so re-submitting the same verb still registers as a
change:
```csharp
entity.Spec.LastRequestedAction = new RequestedAction { Action = action, RequestedAt = DateTime.UtcNow };
await UpdateAsync(id, entity, ct);   // → OnAfterUpdateAsync → NotifySpecChangeAsync → existing ticket reconciles
```
Because this loads the full entity and only mutates one field, `TicketContext` is preserved and the SDK reuses
the ticket (see [04-hooks: Editing a provisioned resource](04-hooks.md)). Require a ticket to already exist
(reject with a clear message if `TicketContext?.TicketId` is empty — actions run *after* first provisioning).

**Logs + history — files in the ticket workdir.** The agent writes each run to
`canvas-documents/{plans,applies}/<runId>.log` (+ a `<runId>.meta.json` with `{runId, ranAt, running, success,
summary}`). The backend serves them by reading the ticket's files — keyed off `entity.TicketContext.TicketId`:
```csharp
using var scope = _scopes.CreateScope();
var ts = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ITicketService>();
var files = await ts.ListTicketFilesAsync(ticketId, "canvas-documents/plans", ct);   // + GetTicketFileAsync(...)
```
Expose `GET {id}/plan-history | apply-history | plans/{runId} | applies/{runId}`. The remote lists runs and
tails the selected log (poll while `meta.running`), rendering ANSI via an `ansiToHtml` pipe with a download
button.

**Idempotency + concurrency (agent skill).** Stamp the processed `requestedAt` to a file (e.g.
`shared/.last-action-processed`) and skip if unchanged, so repeated "spec updated" reconcile messages don't
double-run; guard concurrent applies with a run-lock (`shared/.run-lock`).

**Gotcha:** run history is keyed by `TicketContext.TicketId`, so if an edit spawns a *new* ticket (the PUT bug
in [04-hooks](04-hooks.md)) the prior logs vanish from the UI even though they still exist under the old ticket.

**References:** Terraform extension `TfStatesController`/`TfStateService` (`TriggerActionAsync`, canvas-file
reads), the skill's `tf-dispatch.sh`/`tf-plan.sh`/`tf-apply.sh` (canvas meta+log, `.last-action-processed`
stamp), and the FE `tf-execution-history-panel` (3s poll live tail).

---

**Summary:** lifecycle action → custom controller endpoint; live state → `EnrichResultAsync` (or
`K8sPassthroughServiceBase`); logs/shell → the workspace/scope k8s endpoints + xterm; UI actions →
view-template `cardMenus`/`rowMenus` + `MenuActionEvent`, or buttons in your remote; **any out-of-framework
feature → your own `[HttpGet/Post]` endpoint + your remote calling it via `REMOTE_DuploHttpClient` (§6)**. All
reuse existing platform machinery; none require host changes.
