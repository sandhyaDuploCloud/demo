# 12 — Enrichment & live state (fetch real infra state in C#)

"Enrichment" = on a GET, inject **live, non-persisted** state (running pods, an RDS instance's status, a repo's
latest commit) into `Result` before it's returned. Do it in C# with the SDK — no agent round-trip. This is the
pattern the original MinIO extension needed but couldn't write, because the scope→client helpers weren't in the SDK
(now they are — see [10-sdk-api](10-sdk-api.md)).

## How
Override `EnrichResultAsync` on your service and inject `IScopeClientFactory` (or `IScopeCredentials` for a custom
system). It runs inside `GetByIdAsync` before the entity is returned; failures are caught so a GET never 500s on a
transient infra hiccup.
```csharp
public sealed class MinioService : ResourceServiceBase<Minio, MinioSpec, MinioResult>
{
    private readonly IScopeClientFactory _clients;
    public MinioService(/* base deps */ IScopeClientFactory clients) { _clients = clients; }

    protected override async Task EnrichResultAsync(Minio e, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var k8s = await _clients.GetKubernetesClientAsync(e.Spec.ScopeIds, ct);
        if (k8s is null) return;                                   // no scope attached → leave Result as-is
        var pods = await k8s.Value.Client.CoreV1.ListNamespacedPodAsync(
            e.Spec.Namespace, labelSelector: $"app={e.Spec.AppLabel}", cancellationToken: ct);
        e.Result.Pods = pods.Items.Select(p => new PodInfo(
            p.Metadata.Name, p.Status.Phase,
            p.Status.ContainerStatuses?.All(c => c.Ready) ?? false)).ToList();
    }
}
```
Rules of thumb: **Result holds live data, Spec holds desired config.** Don't persist enriched fields as truth;
re-fetch each GET. Keep enrichment fast (it's on the read path) and never log credentials.

## Enrichment composes with ANY provisioning mode
`EnrichResultAsync` runs unconditionally inside `GetByIdAsync` — it is **independent of how the resource is
provisioned**. So you can combine it with any mode:
- **observe-only** (`IsProvisioningNeeded => false`): nothing is provisioned; enrichment is the only thing that
  fills `Result` (the original MinIO-as-a-viewer case).
- **agent-provisioned** (a skill is mapped): the skill applies the infra and writes the provisioning outputs
  (`POST {id}/results`); enrichment then **augments** `Result` with live state on every read. Don't override
  `IsProvisioningNeeded` — leaving it default keeps the agent path; just add `EnrichResultAsync`. The provision
  skill and the enrichment fill **different** Result fields (skill: deployment/service names + endpoints;
  enrichment: the live pods).
- **passthrough / worker**: same — enrichment layers live state on top of whatever the direct/worker apply wrote.

Worked combined sample (agent provisioning **+** C# enrichment): `samples/enrichment-pods` (its `provision-minio`
skill kubectl-applies a Deployment + Service; its `MinioService.EnrichResultAsync` lists the live pods).

## The Result ↔ view-template contract (the part that bites people)
`Result` is stored as a **BSON document**, so **structure is preserved** — a `List<PodInfo>` round-trips as a JSON
**array**, an object as an object. Therefore:
- **Type your Result fields** (`List<PodInfo> Pods`, not `string PodsJson`).
- In the **frontend view template**, read `Result.pods` **as an array** — do **not** `JSON.parse()` it. Parsing a
  field that's already structured is the #1 "nothing renders" bug. (If you ever store real JSON *as a string*,
  that's the only time to parse — avoid it.)

Worked Result + template: see `samples/enrichment-pods` (its `frontend/` consumes `Result.pods` directly).

## Always annotate — `[BsonIgnoreExtraElements]`
Put `[BsonIgnoreExtraElements]` on **every concrete** entity/`Spec`/`Result` by default — not only when you
later evolve the schema. Two reasons:
1. **Schema evolution (read side):** when you add/remove a `Spec`/`Result` field, existing Mongo documents
   still carry the old shape; without the attribute a read of an old doc throws
   `An error occurred while deserializing …`.
2. **Write-side drop:** the agent's `POST {id}/results` / `{id}/status` JSON is deserialized into your typed
   class, and any key that doesn't map to a declared `[BsonElement]` property is **silently discarded**. So a
   name mismatch between an agent/terraform output and your property **loses the value** — e.g. a terraform
   output `environment_id` (camelCased to `environmentId`) is dropped if your Result declared
   `cloudServicesEnvironmentId` instead. When a result field "won't persist", check the exact key the agent
   posts against your `[BsonElement]` name first.

Put it on the **concrete** class (inheriting it from `BaseSpec`/`BaseResult` is **not** enough):
```csharp
[BsonIgnoreExtraElements]                 // tolerate fields that no longer exist on the class
public sealed class MinioSpec : BaseSpec { /* … */ }
[BsonIgnoreExtraElements]
public sealed class MinioResult : BaseResult { public List<PodInfo> Pods { get; set; } = new(); }
```

## View-template registration ("Template Not Found")
A result page resolves its template by **exact `type` + `subType`** match. If you see
`No view template registered for type='X' subType='y'`:
- The `manifest.json` resource `type`/`subType` must match what the backend stamps
  (`GetTicketOriginType()`/`GetTicketOriginSubType()`), case included.
- The frontend bundle must expose the template and the manifest must reference its path. See
  [09-result-templates](09-result-templates.md) for the declarative template shape.
