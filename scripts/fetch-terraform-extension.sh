# Vendor the DuploCloud Terraform extension's SOURCE into extensions/terraform.
#
# The Terraform extension is a real, shipping DuploCloud extension, open-sourced at
# $TF_EXT_REPO. That repository is itself a full copy of this dev kit; the only part we want is its
# extensions/terraform subdirectory. So we do a blobless partial fetch with a sparse path — nothing
# outside that subdirectory is ever downloaded — then move the subdirectory into place and delete the
# throwaway repo.
#
# What lands in extensions/terraform is PLAIN SOURCE: no .git, no remote, no upstream, no submodule.
# You never pull it and it never updates itself. It is yours to read and to change, exactly like an
# extension you wrote — which is the point.
#
#   ./scripts/fetch-terraform-extension.sh            # fetch if absent; keep what's there otherwise
#   ./scripts/fetch-terraform-extension.sh --force    # re-fetch, moving any existing copy to .bak

# Overrides (developers pointing at a fork or a different pin):
#   TF_EXT_REPO=<git url>   TF_EXT_REF=<branch|tag|sha>   TF_EXT_PATH=<subdir>   TF_EXT_DEST=<dir>
