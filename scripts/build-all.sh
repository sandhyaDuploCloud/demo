# them — so on a native host each one would containerize and `--native` would mean N container builds
# instead of none. (Inside the container they take the native branch regardless, via /.dockerenv and
# the builder service's own DUPLO_BUILD_NATIVE=1.)

# exits 0: it needs no platform, no credentials and no builder image, and CI runs this on every push —
# including on repos that ship no extensions/ at all, with no DUPLO_HOST set. Sourcing _target.sh above
# this point turned that no-op into a hard failure ("DUPLO_TARGET=remote but DUPLO_HOST is unset"). It
# also spent a container start, and possibly a multi-minute image build, to print "nothing to build".

# Canonical layout is extensions/<name>/manifest.json. The legacy singular extension/<name>/ and
# extension/manifest.json layouts are still accepted so older repos keep building.
