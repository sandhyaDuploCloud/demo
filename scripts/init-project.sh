# Adopt this dev-kit clone as YOUR OWN extension project repo.
#
# You clone the dev-kit once, run this, and from then on the repo is yours: your extensions live in extensions/<name>/,
# the dev-kit framework (.claude, scripts, samples, pipelines …) rides along so Claude + CI work on a plain
# checkout, and `scripts/upgrade_dev_kit.sh` pulls newer framework versions without touching extensions/.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/init-project.sh <your-git-remote-url> [--keep-history] [--no-sample] [--name <slug>]
#
#   <your-git-remote-url>   git remote to push YOUR repo to (e.g. git@github.com:me/my-extension.git)
#   --keep-history          keep the dev-kit's git history; just re-point 'origin' (default: start fresh history)
#   --no-sample             don't seed the first extension with a starter (leave a placeholder instead)
#   --name <slug>           name of the first extension dir under extensions/ (default: helloworld). A repo can
#                           hold many extensions — each lives in its own extensions/<name>/.
