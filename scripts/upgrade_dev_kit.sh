# Clones the dev-kit from the FIXED official URL (scripts/_devkit.sh — never a user-supplied source) into a
# cache, then refreshes ONLY the framework-owned paths listed below (allowlist). Everything else in this repo —
# extensions/, .env, docker-compose-overrides, and any other file you add — is left untouched.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/upgrade_dev_kit.sh [--version <branch|tag|commit>] [--yes]
#     --version <ref>   dev-kit version to move to (branch / tag / commit). Default: main
#     --yes             apply without the interactive confirmation (for scripted/CI use)

# Framework-owned paths (allowlist). ONLY these are refreshed; anything else is preserved.

#   FRAMEWORK_MERGE_DIRS — SHARED with the user (e.g. docs/, where authors add their own docs): framework files
