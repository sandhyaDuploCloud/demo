# Sourced by scripts/build-extension.sh and scripts/build-all.sh — decides whether a build runs on the
# caller's machine or inside the builder container, and launches the container when it should.
#
# Why a container at all: the dev-kit's runtime is entirely containerized, but the build was not — it
# hard-required `jq dotnet npm zip curl unzip` on the developer's laptop (and `jq` isn't shipped by
# macOS, so it was an undeclared prerequisite that failed at line 15). Docker Compose is now the only
# prerequisite.

# REQUIRES scripts/_target.sh, sourced FIRST: this file uses its `_envv` (to read .env for BUILDER_IMAGE /
# BUILDER_PULL / BUILDER_TAG / STUDIO_PORT) and its `_TARGET`. Both current callers do source it first;
# that is a requirement of sourcing this file, not an accident of their layout.

# Accepts the spellings a human actually types into an env var, case-insensitively, because
# DUPLO_BUILD_NATIVE is documented as a boolean and `DUPLO_BUILD_NATIVE=true` silently getting a
# *container* build would defeat the whole point of an escape hatch. Unset/empty is false — that's the
# normal "env var not set" case, not an error. Anything else is genuine garbage and is rejected rather
# than coerced, so a typo (or a probe in Task 3 that starts echoing something unexpected) fails loudly.
