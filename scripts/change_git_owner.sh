# upgradable later with ./scripts/upgrade_dev_kit.sh.

# Usage:
#   ./scripts/change_git_owner.sh <your-git-remote-url> [--keep-history]
#     <your-git-remote-url>   git remote to own this repo (e.g. git@github.com:me/my-extensions.git)
#     --keep-history          keep the dev-kit's git history; just re-point 'origin' (default: FRESH history)
